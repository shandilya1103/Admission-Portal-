## PU Meet Frontend

This is a [Next.js] project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`]

## Getting Started

First clone this project on you local machine

Then install the project dependencies:

```
npm install or yarn
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/*](http://localhost:3000/api/*). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/*.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
