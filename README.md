# Admission-Portal-
I have developed a website for Admissions in Universities for Students. We have Used Python's Django Framework for Developing the BackEnd of this project and  React and Next js for developing the Frontend. We have taken the Example of the PULEET Exams which happens in Panjab University for the admissions of students.. 

Use the frontend folder to access frontend files and the backend folder to access the backend..
